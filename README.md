# SPL_for_mac
MacOSX version of SPL. Most features rely on command line, which I don't know. Replace the functions with appropriate commands.
This code might not work because of me not knowing how to use subprocess with mac. The SPL() class features should work
but the command line WILL BE DISABLED. If you know how to use command line in mac (which I don't), just edit it with
self.cmd('whatever_command_the_function_does')
